This was a group project for Database Design (CS206) in which we designed a database for an imaginary company as if they were our client. We were given a scope of requirements that the imaginary client provided. We then went through the following process:
1. Created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) from the requirements provided to us.
2. Mapped a Relational Schema using the ERD and then normalized the data to the 3rd normal form.
3. Created the tables and relations in SQL via Microsoft Access to match the normalized schema.
4. Added forms, reports, and queries including a Navigation Form.
5. Finalized by adding test data to ensure functionality.
