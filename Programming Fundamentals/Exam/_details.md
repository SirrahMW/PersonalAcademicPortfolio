# Details
I was given 90 minutes to create this simple program that uses a hierarchy of related objects and inherited methods and properties.
The objective was to create a program that could create an Author object that could contain what books were written and details about the Author. Because of the limited time frame, this program is very barebones with limited required input and limited input validation. However it met the rubric of the assignment listed below:
- Appropriate data types
- Constructors initialize private members from data passed on object instantiation
- Inheritance is used
- The program logic is good/logical
- Accessors for private primitive variables
- Testing of BookAuthor instantiation and print of data from all 3 objects
