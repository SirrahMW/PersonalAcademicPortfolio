# Personal Repository
This repository functions as an easy way for me to prove some of my knowledge and abilities to potential employers. A majority of the content is prior coursework from my time at Columbia Basin College, where I graduated with my BAS in Cyber Security. Any other relevant projects, professional or personal, will get added over time. The link for this repo should be included on my résumé upon application.

## Database Design
This is the result of a group project for Database Design class in which we designed a database for an imaginary company as if they were our client. We were given a scope of requirements that the imaginary client provided. We then went through the following process:
1. Created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) from the requirements provided to us.
2. Mapped a Relational Schema using the ERD and then normalized the data to the 3rd normal form.
3. Created the tables and relations in SQL via Microsoft Access to match the normalized schema.
4. Added forms, reports, and queries including a Navigation Form.
5. Finalized by adding test data to ensure functionality.

## Programming Fundamentals
The content of this folder should act as proof of my foundational knowledge of the Python programming language. I still consider myself a novice, but I feel confident that I have the tools and knowledge at my disposal to use Python however is needed.
